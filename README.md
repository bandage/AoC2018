# AoC2018
  
So, I've decided to join in with the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2018/) in 2018.
  
I've no idea how far I'll get, but it's going to give me plenty of opportunity to learn new things as its all completely new to me anyway!
  
#### Things learnt so far:
  
 * d1: The "open" funtion to import data from a file <br>     split() method to break a string into a list<br>

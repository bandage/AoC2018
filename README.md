# AoC2018So
I've decided to join in with the Advent of Code in 2018.
I've no idea how far I'll get, but it's going to give me plenty of opportunity to learn new things as its all completely new to me anyway!

Things learnt:
	d1: open funtion to import data from a file.
	    split() method to break a string into a list
